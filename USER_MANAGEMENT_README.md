# User Management System - UI Implementation

This document describes the user management system UI that has been implemented as the first step. The system includes authentication forms, user profile management, and account settings - all built with mock data for now.

## 🚀 Features Implemented

### Authentication
- **Login Form**: Email/password authentication with form validation
- **Signup Form**: User registration with comprehensive fields and validation
- **Auth Modal**: Modal component that switches between login and signup forms
- **User Context**: React context for managing authentication state throughout the app

### User Profile Management
- **Profile Page**: View and edit personal information (name, email, phone)
- **Orders Page**: View order history with mock data
- **Addresses Page**: Manage shipping addresses (add, edit, delete, set default)
- **Settings Page**: Account preferences, security settings, and account actions

### Navigation Integration
- **Navbar Updates**: Added authentication button and user dropdown
- **Mobile Menu**: Mobile-friendly account navigation
- **Protected Routes**: Account pages are protected and redirect unauthenticated users

## 🎯 How to Use

### 1. Testing the System
Visit `/test-auth` to test the authentication system:
- Use any email/password combination to test login
- View authentication status and user information
- Test navigation to account pages

### 2. Authentication Flow
1. **Sign In**: Click the "Sign In" button in the navbar
2. **Switch Forms**: Toggle between login and signup in the modal
3. **Form Validation**: All forms include client-side validation
4. **Success Handling**: Successful authentication closes the modal and updates the UI

### 3. Account Management
Once authenticated, users can:
- **Profile**: Edit personal information
- **Orders**: View order history (currently mock data)
- **Addresses**: Manage shipping addresses
- **Settings**: Configure preferences and security

### 4. Navigation
- **Desktop**: User dropdown in the top-right navbar
- **Mobile**: Account section in the mobile menu
- **Protected Routes**: Account pages automatically redirect unauthenticated users

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Management
- **UserContext**: Centralized user state management
- **Mock Data**: Simulated user data for development
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators throughout the UI

### Form Handling
- **Controlled Components**: All forms use React controlled inputs
- **Validation**: Client-side validation with error messages
- **Submission States**: Loading states during form submission

### Styling
- **Tailwind CSS**: Consistent with existing project design
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach
- **Accessibility**: Proper labels, focus states, and ARIA attributes

## 🚧 Next Steps (API Integration)

This UI implementation is ready for the next phase - integrating with Shopify's Storefront API:

### 1. Customer Authentication
- Replace mock login/signup with Shopify customer mutations
- Implement proper token management
- Add password reset functionality

### 2. Customer Data
- Fetch real customer data from Shopify
- Implement customer update mutations
- Add address management with Shopify

### 3. Order Management
- Fetch real orders from Shopify
- Implement order tracking
- Add order details pages

### 4. Security
- Implement proper session management
- Add CSRF protection
- Secure API endpoints

## 🎨 Design Features

### Modern UI Elements
- **Smooth Animations**: Modal transitions and hover effects
- **Consistent Spacing**: Following Tailwind's spacing scale
- **Icon Integration**: Lucide React icons throughout
- **Color Scheme**: Consistent with existing project colors

### User Experience
- **Form Feedback**: Success/error messages
- **Loading States**: Spinners and disabled states
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## 🧪 Testing

The system includes a comprehensive test page at `/test-auth` that allows developers to:
- Test authentication flows
- Verify user state management
- Check navigation functionality
- Validate form behaviors

## 📱 Browser Support

- **Modern Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions)
- **Mobile**: iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile
- **Responsive**: All screen sizes supported

## 🔒 Security Notes

**Important**: This is currently a UI-only implementation with mock data. When integrating with real APIs:
- Implement proper authentication tokens
- Add CSRF protection
- Validate all user inputs server-side
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement rate limiting

## 📚 Dependencies

The system uses these existing project dependencies:
- **React 19**: For component management
- **Next.js 15**: For routing and app structure
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling
- **Lucide React**: For icons

No additional dependencies were added for this implementation.

## 🎉 Summary

The user management UI is now fully implemented and ready for testing. Users can:
- Sign up and log in through a beautiful modal interface
- Manage their profiles, addresses, and preferences
- Navigate seamlessly between account sections
- Enjoy a responsive, accessible design

The next phase will involve replacing the mock data and functions with real Shopify Storefront API calls, but the UI foundation is solid and ready for production use.
